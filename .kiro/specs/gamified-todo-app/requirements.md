# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a gamified TODO list application inspired by Habitica and LifeUp. The application will transform task management into an engaging RPG-like experience where users earn experience points, level up their character, and unlock rewards by completing tasks. The system will be built as a cross-platform solution using Next.js for web and React Native for mobile, with Supabase handling backend services.

The core philosophy is to make productivity fun and rewarding by applying game mechanics to real-life tasks, helping users build positive habits and achieve their goals through intrinsic motivation.
